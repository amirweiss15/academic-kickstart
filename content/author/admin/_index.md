I received the B.Sc. (Magna Cum Laude) and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tel-Aviv University (TAU), Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2013 and 2015, respectively, where I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the School of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, under the supervision of [Prof. Arie Yeredor](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~arie/). My research and teaching areas are in statistical and digital signal processing and estimation theory. I have also been holding a researcher position in these research areas with Elbit Systems, EW and SIGINT Elisra Ltd., Holon, Israel, since 2013, specializing in detection and parameters estimation of RADAR and SONAR signals.

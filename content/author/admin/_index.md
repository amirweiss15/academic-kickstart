I received the B.Sc. (magna cum laude), M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tel-Aviv University (TAU), Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2013, 2015 and 2020, respectively, where I was very fortunate to have [Prof. Arie Yeredor](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~arie/) as my supervisor. I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, hosted by [Prof. Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/). Previously, I was Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, hosted by [Prof. Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home). My main research areas are in statistical and digital signal processing, array processing, estimation theory, and the applications of machine learning therein. I have also held a (part-time) researcher position in these research areas with Elbit Systems, EW and SIGINT Elisra Ltd., Holon, Israel, from 2013 to 2020, specializing in detection and parameters estimation of RADAR and SONAR signals.

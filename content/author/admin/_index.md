## **About me** ##

I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Faculty of Engineering](https://engineering.biu.ac.il/en) at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en) (BIU).

I am interested in what I like to think of as “machine-learning-enhanced statistical signal processing”, an emerging interdisciplinary field where signal processing, machine learning, estimation theory, and some elements of information theory meet. The kinds of problems I currently focus on are related to communication systems, localization, sensing and compression. My research spans both pure theoretical aspects as well as application-driven practical problems.

Before joining BIU, I spent three wonderful years as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, where I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, where I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home). I received the B.Sc. (magna cum laude), M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2013, 2015 and 2020, respectively, where I was very fortunate to have [Prof. Arie Yeredor](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~arie/) as my supervisor.

My main research areas are in statistical and digital signal processing, array processing, estimation theory, and the applications of machine learning therein. I have also held a (part-time) researcher position in these research areas with Elbit Systems, EW and SIGINT Elisra Ltd., Holon, Israel, from 2013 to 2020, specializing in detection and parameters estimation of RADAR and SONAR signals. -->
